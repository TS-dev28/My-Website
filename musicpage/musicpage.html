Of course, you will be able to listen to them, and some, I presume (as soon as I figure out how to add download compatibility to the page), will be downloadable.

<h1 id="introduction" align="left" style="font-family: Blackbird;font-size: 45px; padding: 25px"> Why upload here? Why not do it on YouTube/Facebook/Twitter...(any other platform you can name...)?</h1>

<p align="left"> Very simple. One word: Copyright. Most of the sites you can think of have very strict copyright rules, so much so that even if a song that may be copyrighted is played for only a second, the entire audio is sacrificed, ultimately disrupting the overall flow of the track. I don't think you'd want to hear audio with static-y portions and neither do I. </p>

<p align="left"> Also, as a side reason, I want to personalize the way I upload files/projects. I do not want to rely on other domains to host my files (even though this project will probably be hosted on a domain-hosting service such as GitHub). Surely I can't be fully independent from third party services, but I am looking to minimize it as much as possible.</p>

<p align="left"> In a certain sense, this personal website is a project in it of itself. I only recently started learning HTML and CSS (started approx. June 28, 2020 or so), so I think this is a good barometer of my capabilities. </p>

	<h1 align="left" style="font-family: Blackbird;font-size: 45px; padding: 25px"> What Type of Music Can I Expect? </h1>
	
<p align="left"> Well, I am not musically gifted to make my own music, so I primarily use others' works and mix and match them together. I create mashups, medleys, and mixes (wow, much m's such wow <img src="images/doge.jpg" height="30" width="30">). I'm also hoping to get into remixing tracks, but at the moment, it seems far away. </p>

<h1 align="left" style="font-family: Blackbird;font-size: 45px; padding: 25px"> How Often Will This Page be Updated?</h1>
	
<p align="left"> As long as I have the time and motivation to work on projects, I will keep this page updated. As I mentioned in the homepage, I might be late with some updates because of college/life/other factors you're possibly theorizing about, so please have some patience. <br/> With that being said...enjoy the projects!</p>
